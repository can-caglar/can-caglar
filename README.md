## :heart: Passion

- Bare-metal C (with the STM32 family in particular!)
- Embedded Test Driven Development (TDD)
- Realtime embedded software using FreeRTOS
- Embedded OOP design with C++

I am passionate about writing clean, efficient, and well-tested code for embedded systems. 

I love having the freedom to express creatively, the challenge of designing solutions for complex problems, and the satisfaction of seeing my code come to life to be used in beneficial ways.
